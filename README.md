## BANK SYSTEM
This project is a Bank System Simulation built with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It demonstrates how core programming concepts can be applied to solve real-world problems such as:

Managing customer accounts.
Handling deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks.
## Features
Create and manage multiple bank accounts.

Deposit and withdraw money with validation.

Display account information and transaction history.

Use of OOP concepts (Classes, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism).

Clean, modular, and extendable design.
## Technologies Used
C++ (Core language).
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
Clean code
## This project helped me strengthen my skills in:

Applying OOP principles in real-world simulations.
Implementing Data Structures inside a practical project.
Writing clean, modular, and reusable code.
Problem-solving and debugging.
